Islington is one of the poorest boroughs with many families living in poverty and a high crime rate. Our support goes beyond the young person, and includes local families and the wider community. Our work helps to reduce anti-social behaviour by encouraging young people to improve life and employment skills through our projects and help to create opportunities. If young people are able to positively contribute to their local community this helps to create community cohesion.
