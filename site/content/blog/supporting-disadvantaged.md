We are a local community charity, dedicated to helping the young people within the Borough of Islington, working with young people who may be at risk of falling into a lifestyle of knife crime, drugs and violence, creating opportunities to realise and fulfill their potential. Our service takes young people on their own Prospex journey with a commitment to always putting young people first. We offer street outreach, junior and senior sessions, girls club, holiday schemes and accredited learning.
